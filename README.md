# Phonon Simulator
This is a project which simulates the motion of phonons within cells, using real-world physics.
View the "cells" as empty vacuums, these cells provide no resistance to the phonons travelling through them.

The cells within this simulation are placed linearly, and when the simulation begins the phonons begin coming in through either end:

Below is an example of how the phonons move through the cells:

The simulation will detect the temperature of each cell, and where all the phonons move through them.
When it begins running, a console with open up:

Once it is done, the data will be saved to a JSON file!
